## List technologies used:

To complete this project I used the following technologies:
  *html
  *css
  *javascript
  *ajax
  *bootstrap
  *jquery
  *git

## Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

My planning started with the wireframs that I drew in my notebook. Originally, i had a grand vision of making them neater in a computer program, but i quickly realised my time would be better spent elsewhere for the project.

The game scope assignment we completed also helped me with my planning because it made me think about the different parts of the game. Below is what I turned in for that assignment.

```
The data structure you plan to use.
The value of the game board cells will be stored in an array. Each index will represent a specific place on the game board
How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
the game board will be manipulated in JS by event listeners that listen for clicks in the DOM, and when a certain element is clicked the proper value will be pushed to an array of the game data through an API call, then the ui will be updated based on the event that just took place
How you plan to approach this project.
the project will be approached in a very methodical way. First the html to create the proper elements, then the events.js, then the api.js, then the ui.js, and finally css will be linked to style the SPA appropriately. Once i know the timeline for when the project is due i will create a schedule with goals to be accomplished along the way.
How you plan to keep your code modular.
i plan to keep my code modular by breaking it up in different JS files that each do distinct things such as API calls, ui manipulation, and event listening. also the styles will be seperate from the html.
What creative spin will you add to your project?
adding music to the game will make it more enjoyable for users
How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
I will use git for version control. I will also make commits each time new functionality is implemented and i think for practice i should make a limit on how many lines of code i am allowed to write before a commit becomes mandatory for me.
What additional features will you build if you have extra time?
multiplayer from multiple devices, if a user wins 10 times in a row a special award is presented to them
```

During development, I planned to tackle all of the game logic first but got sidetracked by styling the gameboard. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing because my board design has been very stable, but it was frustrating to still have some requirements left to finish on the last project workday.



## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
  *The biggest unsolved problem is that when player_o is logged in they are not attached to the game when the game is started
  *When one player is logged in a computer should play against them
  *True multi-device multiplayer
## Link to wireframes and user stories.

```
4-8 user stories for your game project.
As a user i want to be able to select if i am x or o because i have a lucky letter
as a user i want to have a time limit placed on how long moves can take becasue i want games to be as short as possible
as a user i want to play music in the background because music helps me focus my tic tac toe energy
as a user i want to be able to place my letter in multiple spots to see how the game board would look before i submit my final selection
as a user i want to have an awesome celebration message displayed when i win
